# ðŸ”— Chain Reaction Game

Chain Reaction is a multiplayer strategy game where players take turns placing orbs in cells of a grid.  
When a cell reaches its critical mass, it explodes and sends orbs into neighboring cells â€” potentially causing cascading chain reactions across the board.  
The goal is to dominate the grid by eliminating your opponents' orbs.
