# N-Puzzle Solver Using A* Search

## Objective
The project implements a program that solves the **N-Puzzle problem** using the **A\* search algorithm**.  

Here,  
- \( n = k^2 - 1 \),  
- \( k = 3, 4, 5, ...\)

The program should determine the optimal sequence of moves to reach the goal configuration from a given initial configuration.

## Problem Description
The **N-Puzzle** is a classic AI benchmark problem, invented in the 1870s by Noyes Palmer Chapman. It consists of a \( k \times k \) board with \( n = k^2 - 1 \) tiles numbered 1 to \( n \) and a single blank tile. Players slide tiles horizontally or vertically into the blank space to reach the goal configuration:
