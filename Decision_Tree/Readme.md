# ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Classifier

This project implements an experimental **Decision Tree** machine learning algorithm from scratch which transforms
categorical data into numerical and observes its performance

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Builds a decision tree from training data.
- Supports both categorical and numerical features.
- Flexible splitting criteria:
  - **IG** â†’ measures reduction in entropy.  
  - **IGR** â†’ normalizes IG to avoid bias toward attributes with many values.  
  - **NWIG** â†’ balances IG with weighted normalization for fairer splits.
